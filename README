TapeRayAndroid is a small android application that acts as a webclient
to the undocumented TapeRay XML API for getting access to the categories
and artworks of the TapeRay content pool.

The appliction does not store any information locally but retrieves everything
from the TapeRay application server. Hence, there is no need for cache file
housekeeping or any other magic.

The selection code is simply a straight-forward list view that is filled with
data received by XML documents.

The preview activity is the only really interesting part as it overlays a live
camera image with a ImageView displaying a alpha-channel enabled image.

The code for TouchImageView was written Michael Ortiz and Patrick Lackemacher,
