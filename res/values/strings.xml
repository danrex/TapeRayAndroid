	    TapeRay was developed as a community for art-enthusiasts using vinyl
	    foil as their expression media. This type of art is also widely known
	    as WALL DECAL.
     	This application is able to map all TapeRay artworks into a live
        video image, recorded by the camera of your mobile phone.
        You can resize the artworks with finger gestures and move them around
        to get a feeling of how they might look like on the place where you want
        them. Check out our website for more information: http://taperay.com
